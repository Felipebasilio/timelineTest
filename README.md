# Timeline Component

A React-based timeline visualization component that efficiently arranges items in horizontal lanes with advanced features including zoom, drag-and-drop editing, and inline name editing.

## Features

- **Efficient Lane Assignment**: Items are automatically arranged in compact horizontal lanes to minimize vertical space
- **Zoom Functionality**: Mouse wheel zoom (Ctrl/Cmd + scroll) and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + +/-/0)
- **Drag & Drop Editing**: Resize timeline items by dragging their start/end handles
- **Inline Name Editing**: Click on item names to edit them directly
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern UI with hover effects and visual feedback
- **Keyboard Accessibility**: Full keyboard support for all interactions

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

## Usage

The timeline component accepts an array of items with the following structure:

```javascript
const items = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Project Alpha",
    start: "2024-01-15",
    end: "2024-02-20"
  },
  // ... more items
];

<TimelineContainer items={items} onItemsChange={handleItemsChange} />
```

## Architecture

The component follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **TimelineContainer**: Main orchestrator handling data processing and zoom state
- **TimelineHeader**: Displays statistics and zoom controls
- **TimelineRuler**: Shows month markers and timeline scale
- **TimelineLanesContainer**: Manages the collection of timeline lanes
- **TimelineLane**: Individual lane containing timeline items
- **TimelineItem**: Individual timeline item with drag and edit capabilities

## Implementation Reflection

### What I like about my implementation:

1. **Clean Architecture**: The component follows React best practices with clear separation of concerns. Each component has a single responsibility, making the codebase maintainable and testable.

2. **Comprehensive Feature Set**: Beyond the basic requirements, I implemented advanced features like zoom functionality, drag-and-drop editing, and inline name editing, creating a polished user experience.

3. **Robust Lane Assignment**: The lane assignment algorithm efficiently packs items into the minimum number of lanes while maintaining readability, even with complex overlapping scenarios.

4. **Zoom Implementation**: The zoom functionality is sophisticated, supporting both mouse wheel zoom with proper centering and keyboard shortcuts, with smooth visual feedback.

5. **Comprehensive Testing**: The test suite covers edge cases, different zoom levels, and various data scenarios, ensuring reliability.

6. **Performance Optimization**: Used React hooks like `useCallback` and `useMemo` appropriately to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### What I would change if I were to do it again:

1. **State Management**: For a larger application, I would implement a more robust state management solution (like Redux or Zustand) to handle complex state interactions between components.

2. **Virtualization**: For timelines with hundreds of items, I would implement virtual scrolling to maintain performance.

3. **Drag & Drop Library**: I would use a more sophisticated drag-and-drop library (like react-dnd) for better touch support and more complex drag interactions.

4. **Date Handling**: I would use a more robust date library like date-fns or dayjs instead of native Date objects for better timezone handling and date manipulation.

5. **Responsive Design**: I would add more responsive breakpoints and mobile-specific interactions for better mobile experience.

6. **Animation**: I would add smooth transitions and animations for item movements, zoom changes, and state transitions.

7. **Undo/Redo**: I would implement an undo/redo system for timeline edits.

8. **CSS Framework**: I would add a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS or styled-components to simplify styling, reduce custom CSS, and ensure better consistency across components.

### How I made my design decisions:

1. **Component Architecture**: I followed the Container/Presentational pattern, separating data logic from presentation. This was inspired by React best practices and makes the code more testable and maintainable.

2. **Lane Assignment Algorithm**: I used the provided `assignLanes.js` as a starting point but enhanced it to handle edge cases better. The algorithm sorts items by start date and assigns them to the first available lane, which is efficient and predictable.

3. **Zoom Implementation**: I researched how other timeline libraries handle zoom (like Gantt charts and project management tools) and implemented a similar approach with mouse wheel zoom centered on cursor position.

4. **UI/UX Design**: I looked at modern project management tools like Asana, Monday.com, and Linear for inspiration on timeline design, focusing on clean aesthetics and intuitive interactions.

5. **Drag & Drop**: I implemented custom drag handles rather than using a library to have full control over the interaction and to keep dependencies minimal.

6. **Styling Approach**: I used CSS custom properties and modern CSS features for maintainable styling, inspired by design systems like Material Design and Ant Design.

### How I would test this if I had more time:

1. **Visual Regression Testing**: I would implement visual regression testing using tools like Chromatic or Percy to catch UI changes across different browsers and screen sizes.

2. **End-to-End Testing**: I would add comprehensive E2E tests using Playwright or Cypress to test the complete user workflows, including drag-and-drop, zoom, and editing scenarios.

3. **Performance Testing**: I would implement performance testing to measure rendering times with large datasets (1000+ items) and optimize accordingly.

4. **Accessibility Testing**: I would add automated accessibility testing using tools like axe-core and manual testing with screen readers.

5. **Cross-Browser Testing**: I would test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

6. **User Testing**: I would conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the interface and interactions.

7. **Load Testing**: I would test the component with various data loads to identify performance bottlenecks.

8. **Integration Testing**: I would add tests for the component's integration with different data sources and state management solutions.

9. **Error Boundary Testing**: I would test error scenarios and ensure graceful degradation.

10. **Memory Leak Testing**: I would add tests to ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and prevent memory leaks.

The current implementation provides a solid foundation with comprehensive unit tests, but these additional testing strategies would ensure the component is production-ready for enterprise use.
